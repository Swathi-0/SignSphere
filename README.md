## Abstract

Communication barriers between individuals who use Indian Sign Language (ISL) and those who rely on spoken or written language pose significant challenges, particularly in domains such as education, healthcare, and social integration. This project proposes an advanced system that bridges this gap by enabling seamless bidirectional translation between ISL and English, with added support for regional languages like Kannada.

Our solution integrates:

- **Computer Vision** for real-time ISL gesture recognition
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for accurate grammatical conversions

The system translates sign language into text or speech and vice versa, adhering to ISL grammar rules and accommodating regional linguistic nuances. Innovative features such as dynamic gesture recognition using LSTM, real-time non-manual signal interpretation, and animated sign output ensure a comprehensive and user-friendly experience. The solution addresses gaps in existing systems by incorporating a dictionary-based approach for ISL sign matching and synonym replacement.

This project aspires to empower individuals with hearing and speech disabilities by making technology more accessible, fostering inclusion, and enabling equitable communication across diverse linguistic landscapes.

## Approach

Our approach involves developing an advanced translation system that integrates cutting-edge technologies to enable real-time bidirectional communication. The solution includes:

1. **Gesture Recognition**:

   - Employing computer vision techniques and LSTM models to accurately identify static and dynamic ISL gestures, including non-manual signals such as facial expressions and body postures.

2. **Text/Speech-to-Sign Conversion**:

   - Utilizing NLP to parse English text, apply ISL grammar rules, and convert text into animated signs to ensure grammatical correctness.

3. **Regional Language Support**:

   - Incorporating Kannada translation to enhance accessibility and relevance in multilingual contexts.

4. **Enhanced Accessibility**:

   - Providing animated ISL outputs to facilitate learning and interaction for both ISL users and learners.

## Problem Statement

Communication between ISL users and individuals relying on spoken or written language is fraught with barriers, leading to social exclusion and limited access to essential services. Current solutions are inadequate in addressing the following issues:

1. **Unidirectional Translation Systems**:

   - Most systems either translate sign language to text or vice versa but do not provide seamless two-way communication.

2. **Neglect of ISL Grammar**:

   - Sign languages like ISL have unique grammatical structures that are often overlooked, resulting in inaccurate translations that fail to convey context effectively.

3. **Non-Manual Features Ignored**:

   - Facial expressions and body postures, essential components of ISL, are not accounted for in most solutions, reducing translation accuracy.

4. **Lack of Regional Language Support**:

   - Indiaâ€™s linguistic diversity is not adequately addressed, limiting accessibility for regional language users like Kannada speakers.

5. **Complexity and Accessibility**:

   - Existing systems require complex setups or typing, which are not user-friendly for ISL users who rely on gestures for communication.

## Key Features

- **Bidirectional Translation**: Real-time communication in both directions between ISL and text/speech.
- **Grammar-Adhering Translations**: Ensures grammatically correct ISL translations.
- **Dynamic Gesture Recognition**: Identifies static and dynamic gestures, including non-manual signals.
- **Regional Language Integration**: Supports Kannada and potentially other regional languages.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplified setup and intuitive interaction for all users.
